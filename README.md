- 👋 Hello everyone ! I’m @AureLeeLi aka Aurélie, i am 40 and in the middle of a career change since March 2023.
Having worked as a restaurant manager for more than 10 years, the digital path opened up to me after a skills assessment.So since May 2023 I started my first lines of code (1-Swift and Swift UI with the Apple Foundation Program at Simplon, 2-HTML CSS JavaScript at the Digital Nursery at Euratechnologies-Lille ). So barely 4 months ago, so here are my first steps! 
- 🌱 Since September 29, 2023, I have been training as a web and mobile developer with M2i Formation (Hauts-de-France, Villeneuve d'Ascq - Parc de la Haute Borne), which means a few days ago!
- 👀 I’m interested and would be delighted to discuss with you, get advice, and share!
- 💞️ I would therefore put here my practical work requested by the trainers as well as my personal achievements, since my concrete entry into this world!
- 📫 How to reach me : LinkedIn Aurélie Duynslaeger ! 
See you soon ! 🙌🏻✌🏻
